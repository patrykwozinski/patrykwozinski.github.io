# Three simple testing tricks using PHP and Symfony
Hi! Iâ€™ve written this post to help you and keep in history something that makes application testing easier. The first two tricks are related to the **PHP Symfony** web framework and functional/integration testing in this framework, but the second one is a pattern that every PHP engineer should know. You can treat this article as a note created for me from the past.

### Separated implementations for functional testing and the other environments
While I was working on my side-project I needed something that enables me to use different implementations of some interfaces in the testing environment and the others. I couldnâ€™t find it in the framework guide so maybe itâ€™s helpful not only for me.
In the example, we have an interface like:
```php
interface Customers
{
	/** @throws CustomerNotFound **/
	public function ofId(CustomerId $id): Customer;
}

```

And we have also two implementations. First one is a DoctrineORM implementation:
```php
final class DoctrineORMCustomers implements Customers
{
	public function ofId(CustomerId $id): Customer
	{
		// Blabla using EntityManager stuff
	}
}
```

The second one implementation is just **InMemory** version that we need in the tests (for example units). Yes - thatâ€™s just a fake test double implementation. ;)
```php
final class InMemoryCustomers implements Customers
{
	public function ofId(CustomerId $id): Customer
	{
		// Blabla using in memory
	}
}
```

Okay, at this moment we have two implementations. One is using external things (in this example Doctrine and database) and the second one is working in memory so itâ€™s using state of the object.

As you may know or now - functional tests are not using third party adapters. They should just check the flow and the final result of a request. For example - check the status code of a response.

Coming to the point - we want to use it in different situations - other implementations. As a default, weâ€™re registering services in something like `/config/services.yaml`. But how to change implementation for the tests? Iâ€™ve moved definitions to the `/config/packages/services.yaml` and created `/config/packages/test/services.yaml` with the same keys but different implementation classes. Thatâ€™s easy and allows us to make the functional tests as fast as we can do them.
Definitions should looks like:
```yaml /config/packages/services.yaml
services:
	App\Domain\Customers: '@App\Infrastructure\Doctrine\ORM\DoctrineORMCustomers'
```

```yaml /config/packages/test/services.yaml
services:
	App\Domain\Customers: '@App\Infrastructure\InMemory\InMemoryCustomers'
```

Thanks to this you can make some fast functional tests of your application. Remember: tests must be quick because slow tests destroying your developer experience.

### Testing dependency injection container is close to you, seriously
This information is not that hard to find but you can use your testing container (that marks all the services as a public) using a magic static test attribute `static::$container`.
Thanks to this you can easier test some services that are registered as a private for the container. AND! Remember to mark them as **final/private**.

### ObjectMother is your friend
This tip is not related to the Symfony framework but still, itâ€™s really useful. ObjectMother is a great testing pattern that could avoid code duplication and simplify tests. Sometimes your testing code - especially **given** section may look not that cool as you want it to be. The situation could look like the following example:
```php
public function testPremiumCustomerDidSomethingBlabla(): void
{
	// Given
	$email = new Email('patryk.wozinski@example.com', 'verified');
	$address = new Address('Warsaw', 'UrsynÃ³w');
	$customer = new Customer($email, $address);

	// When
	// Blurred :)
}
```

Letâ€™s suppose that PREMIUM CUSTOMER is just a Customer with a verified e-mail address. Now image that - you need the same state of the customer inâ€¦ hmm, seven test cases. Itâ€™s boring and painful to copy&paste code pieces. Andâ€¦ after your change, the `$address` needs the third parameter so you need to change all the seven test cases. Thatâ€™s terrifying!
To avoid such sad situations you can introduce **ObjectMother** pattern in your test code. You can create few objects and then compose them into some detailed object.
Letâ€™s look at the bigger example:
```php
final class EmailMother
{
	private const EMAIL = 'patryk.wozinski@example.com';
	private const STATUS_VERIFIED = 'verified'; // I hate "statuses" but that's just an example xd

	public static function anyVerified(): Email
	{
		return new Email(self::EMAIL, self::STATUS_VERIFIED);
	}
}

final class AddressMother
{
	private const CITY = 'Warsaw';
	private const DISTRICT = 'UrsynÃ³w';

	public static function any(): Address
	{
		return new Address(self::CITY, self::DISTRICT);
	}
}

// And finally the most interesting for us
final class CustomerMother
{
	public static function anyPremium(): Customer
	{
		return new Customer(EmailMother::anyVerified(), AddressMother::any());
	}
}
```

Soâ€¦ right now your testing method could looks like:
```php
public function testPremiumCustomerDidSomethingBlabla(): void
{
	// Given
	$customer = CustomerMother::anyPremium();

	// When
	// Blurred :)
}
```
At this moment any change of the customerâ€™s interiors doesnâ€™t affect your tests. Itâ€™s much CHEAPER and EASIER to maintain. Two wins with just one simple pattern.

Happy coding! ðŸ‘‹
