Today’s post is not a story, it’s just a collection of links to the interesting resources that could be useful for you in this epic journey.

### Books
Actually, I’ve read only two books about Elixir-lang. Both of them were pretty good so I’d like to recommend to you to read both.
- „**Programming Elixir ≥ 1.6: Functional > Concurrent > Pragmatic > Fun**” - Dave Thomas. The biggest advantage of this book is that - it was written for the people that came from the OOP world. I think you are one of them, so read it, it’s useful and light. - [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40654424-programming-elixir-1-6)
- „**Elixir in Action**” - Saša Jurić. Handy, good but not better than the previous one in my opinion. Anyway, it’s worth to read it. - [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20524444-elixir-in-action)

### Concurrency in Elixir
Concurrency is something that we don’t have in PHP so it might be new for you. I recommend you read/watch these videos/articles:
- [Elixir and The Beam: How Concurrency Really Works - DEV](https://dev.to/sophiedebenedetto/elixir-and-the-beam-how-concurrency-really-works-354n)
- [Concurrency and parallelism with Elixir and BEAM](https://medium.com/@patrykbak/concurrency-and-parallelism-with-elixir-and-beam-c683b2215c38)
- [Concurrency in Elixir @ warsaw.ex #8 - PL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQC0cl9Jago)

### Metaprogramming
Metaprogramming is the next thing that we don’t have experience in PHP language. It’s a powerful tool! Be careful with that, because you can create some dragons in your castle.
- [ElixirConf 2017 - Don’t Write Macros   But Do Learn How They Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo48sQDb-hk)
- [Metaprogramming in Elixir @ Elixir Warsaw Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-mxFhVEoWA)

### Pattern matching
One of my favorite things in this language is pattern matching. This language construction enables us to write clean, simple code without tons of if-statements. Of course, pattern matching has tons of other advantages. Check it out!
- [Pattern Matching in Elixir - DEV.to](https://dev.to/flatironschool/pattern-matching-in-elixir-33m1)
- [Elixir Pattern Matching - WomanOnRails](https://womanonrails.com/elixir-pattern-matching)

## Hey you! Share us your resources :)
If you're reading this and do you think I omitted any important learning materials - send them in a comment to this post. Another way is to add them directly to the page via [Pull Request to the post](https://github.com/patrykwozinski/patrykwozinski.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2020-09-17-resources-to-learn-elixir-for-php-devs.md). I think it will be useful for many of us.

**I will update this post whenever I'll find something that might be interesting for all of you**. Feel free to contribute!
