Hi everyone!
This blog post is not about my journey from PHP to Elixir engineering role. Today I want to cover topic of keeping the maximum possible level of happiness and developer experience in your company. If you think it’s easier and better to let people go out - just skip this article and watch some gifs with cats, it’s your choice. :)

So, at first I want to notice that developers are mainly not leaving your company or the team because of salary or your "not JURA X10 coffee machine". They are doing that because of their DX that might be not so good and they want to discover the other products, companies, etc.

Ok, so you can do nothing with that if you have not any metrics. Metrics and the data are the most important to discover and act on the problems.
