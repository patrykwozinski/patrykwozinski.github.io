Hi! After a long time, I'd like to share with you one of my thoughts. Pull Requests, Code Reviews, version control, and git - that's buzzwords with whom we are so familiar on daily software engineering work. That's of course not hard to commit some changes, push to the git repository and then open a pull request, true. After all, we're merging these changes to some branches like master or development, etc. - of course, it depends on your project's git-flow. Nothing interesting, that's the thing that we're teaching interns and juniors, yep.

But... I think it's not that easy as we think, there is one interesting thing that I've considered in the last few days. What's your approach to creating commits and merging? Have you ever thought about it? What's the logic behind your commits and decision about how to merge -> using squash or not? That's the topic that I'd like to cover today! :)
