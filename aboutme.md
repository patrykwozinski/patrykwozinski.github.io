My name is Patryk Woziński.

Product Engineer with many years of experience in creating and designing web applications (both application architecture and code design). I put business values first, which should guide every developer and they control the rest of my work. I have used many technologies and language is not a barrier for me - it's just a tool that allows us to deliver the product. Kent Beck's quote describes me perfectly:

~ "I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits."

I love to share knowledge and learn new things with others. I have experience in conducting presentations and workshops on IT topics like Domain-Driven Design, refactoring, TDD, and Object-Oriented Programming.
